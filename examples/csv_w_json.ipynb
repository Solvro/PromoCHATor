We applied different working memory (WM) measures (Digit Span Forward and Backward, Short-delay and Long-delay CPT-AX, N-back) to patients with SZ (n = 23), psychotic BPD (n = 19) and non-psychotic BPD (n = 24), as well as to healthy controls (HC) (n = 18) in order to compare the level of WM impairments across the groups. With respect to the less demanding WM measures (Digit Span Forward and Backward, Short-delay CPT-AX), there were no between group differences in cognitive performance; however, with respect to the more demanding WM measures (Long-delay CPT-AX, N-back), we observed that the groups with psychosis (SZ, psychotic BPD) did not differ from one another, but performed poorer than the group without a history of psychosis (non-psychotic BPD). A history of psychotic symptoms may influence cognitive performance with respect to WM delay and load effects as measured by Long-delay CPT-AX and N-back tests, respectively. We observed a positive correlation of WM performance with antipsychotic treatment and a negative correlation with depressive symptoms in BPD and with negative symptoms in SZ subgroup. Our study suggests that WM dysfunctions are more closely related to a history of psychosis than to the diagnostic categories of SZ and BPD described by psychiatric classification systems.\", \"ADAPTIVE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC PHYSICAL EFFORT PLAN GENERATION\\\\u2014DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH\": \"Mathematical models delivered using both expert knowledge and experimental data improve understanding of dynamic properties of the system under consideration.

In order to provide high accuracy of EMG onset detection, we developed novel method, that give results similar to that obtained by an expert. By means of this method, EMG is processed in two stages. The first stage gives rough estimation of EMG onset, whereas the second stage performs local, precise searching.

Motivated by the idea of self-managed networks, in the developed framework the decision-making entities are associated with individual transmission links, deciding on the way they split capacity among concurrent flows. An efficient decentralized algorithm is given for computing a strongly Pareto-optimal strategies, constituting a pure Nash equilibrium. Subsequently, we discuss the properties of the introduced game related to the Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. The paper is concluded with an experimental study.\", \"An Algorithm for Rescheduling of Trains under Planned Track Closures\": \"This work considered a joint problem of train rescheduling and closure planning. The derivation of a new train run schedule and the determination of a closure plan not only must guarantee the satisfaction of all the given constraints but also must optimize the number of accepted closures, the number of approved train runs, and the total time shift between the resultant and the original schedule. Presented is a novel nonlinear mixed integer optimization problem which is valid for a broad class of railway networks. A multi-level hierarchical heuristic algorithm is introduced due to the NP-hardness of the considered optimization problem. The algorithm is able, on an iterative basis, to jointly select closures and train runs, along with the derivation of a train schedule. Results obtained by the algorithm, launched for the conducted experiments, confirm its ability to provide acceptable and feasible solutions in a reasonable amount of time.\"}'), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/data_csv_json.csv', 'row': 3}, page_content='Supervisor\\'s name: Grzegorz Filcek\\ninterests: Multiple Criteria OptimizationSupply NetworksComputer NetworksMathematical ModellingTransportation\\nresearch papers: {\"A heuristic algorithm for solving a Multiple Criteria Carpooling Optimization (MCCO) problem\": \"The authors consider in this paper a carpooling optimization problem, which is formulated (based on their previous work) as a constrained multiple criteria decision-making problem.

The formulated problem is focused on the joint matching of carpoolers and planning their routes in order to maximize the utility of all travelers. To solve the problem, the authors develop a heuristic computational procedure that applies a problem-specific heuristic method (carpooler\\\\u2019s matching component) combined with a utility-based shortest path algorithm (routing component).
