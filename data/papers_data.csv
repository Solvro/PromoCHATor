Jaroslaw Drapala,mathematical modeling dynamical systems machine learning exploratory data analysis,"{""Mammalian Host-Versus-Phage immune response determines phage fate in vivo"": ""Emerging bacterial antibiotic resistance draws attention to bacteriophages as a therapeutic alternative to treat bacterial infection. Examples of phage that combat bacteria abound. However, despite careful testing of antibacterial activity in vitro, failures nevertheless commonly occur. We investigated immunological response of phage antibacterial potency in vivo. Anti-phage activity of phagocytes, antibodies and serum complement were identified by direct testing and by high-resolution fluorescent microscopy. We accommodated the experimental data into a mathematical model. We propose a universal schema of innate and adaptive immunity impact on phage pharmacokinetics, based on the results of our numerical simulations. We found that the mammalian-host response to infecting bacteria causes the concomitant removal of phage from the system. We propose the notion that this effect as an indirect pathway of \u2026"", ""Impairments of working memory in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: the effect of history of psychotic symptoms and different aspects of cognitive task demands"": ""Comparisons of cognitive impairments between schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) have produced mixed results. We applied different working memory (WM) measures (Digit Span Forward and Backward, Short-delay and Long-delay CPT-AX, N-back) to patients with SZ (n = 23), psychotic BPD (n = 19) and non-psychotic BPD (n = 24), as well as to healthy controls (HC) (n = 18) in order to compare the level of WM impairments across the groups. With respect to the less demanding WM measures (Digit Span Forward and Backward, Short-delay CPT-AX), there were no between group differences in cognitive performance; however, with respect to the more demanding WM measures (Long-delay CPT-AX, N-back), we observed that the groups with psychosis (SZ, psychotic BPD) did not differ from one another, but performed poorer than the group without a history of psychosis (non-psychotic BPD). A history of psychotic symptoms may influence cognitive performance with respect to WM delay and load effects as measured by Long-delay CPT-AX and N-back tests, respectively. We observed a positive correlation of WM performance with antipsychotic treatment and a negative correlation with depressive symptoms in BPD and with negative symptoms in SZ subgroup. Our study suggests that WM dysfunctions are more closely related to a history of psychosis than to the diagnostic categories of SZ and BPD described by psychiatric classification systems."", ""Induction of Phage-Specific Antibodies by Two Therapeutic Staphylococcal Bacteriophages Administered per os"": ""In therapeutic phage applications oral administration is a common and well-accepted delivery route. Phages applied per os may elicit a specific humoral response, which may in turn affect phage activity. We present specific anti-phage antibody induction in mice receiving therapeutic staphylococcal bacteriophage A3R or 676Z in drinking water. The schedule comprised: (1) primary exposure to phages for 100 days, followed by (2) diet without phage for 120 days, and (3) secondary exposure to the same phage for 44 days. Both phages induced specific antibodies in blood (IgM, IgG, IgA), even though poor to ineffective translocation of the phages to blood was observed. IgM reached a maximum on day 22, IgG increased from day 22 until the end of the experiment. Specific IgA in the blood and in the gut were induced simultaneously within about 2 months; the IgA level gradually decreased when phage was removed from the diet. Importantly, phage-specific IgA was the limiting factor for phage activity in the gastrointestinal tract. Multicopy proteins (major capsid protein and tail morphogenetic protein H) contributed significantly to phage immunogenicity (IgG), while the baseplate protein gpORF096 did not induce a significant response. Microbiome composition assessment by next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that no important changes correlated with phage treatment."", ""Adaptive decision support system for automatic physical effort plan generation\u2014data-driven approach"": ""Mathematical models delivered using both expert knowledge and experimental data improve understanding of dynamic properties of the system under consideration. This is useful for different purposes, such as prediction, diagnosis, decision making, and system control. A data-driven approach has been found to be particularly useful in designing adaptive decision support systems. We demonstrate the usefulness of data-driven models in a custom application designed for sport training management. We have developed a system that makes use of expert knowledge together with measurement data (heart rate, electromyography, and acceleration) as well as environmental (Global Positioning System) in order to generate an optimal training plan. The system performs such tasks as modeling of the athlete's cardiovascular system, estimation of the athlete's parameters, and adaptation of the model to the athlete."", ""Two stage EMG onset detection method"": ""Detection of the moment when a muscle begins to activate on the basis of EMG signal is important task for a number of biomechanical studies. In order to provide high accuracy of EMG onset detection, we developed novel method, that give results similar to that obtained by an expert. By means of this method, EMG is processed in two stages. The first stage gives rough estimation of EMG onset, whereas the second stage performs local, precise searching. The method was applied to support signal processing in biomechanical study concerning effect of body position on EMG activity and peak muscle torque stabilizing spinal column under static conditions.""}"
Dariusz Gasior,virtual networks autonomic networks self-managed networks,"{""Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium in capacity allocation game for self-managed networks"": ""In this paper we introduce a capacity allocation game which models the problem of maximizing network utility from the perspective of distributed noncooperative agents. Motivated by the idea of self-managed networks, in the developed framework the decision-making entities are associated with individual transmission links, deciding on the way they split capacity among concurrent flows. An efficient decentralized algorithm is given for computing a strongly Pareto-optimal strategies, constituting a pure Nash equilibrium. Subsequently, we discuss the properties of the introduced game related to the Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. The paper is concluded with an experimental study."", ""QoS rate allocation in computer networks under uncertainty"": ""The purpose of this paper is to examine the problem of rate allocation (RA) in computer networks in cases when some parameters are unknown or their values are imprecise.The application of uncertain variables for the RA problems in computer networks in the presence of uncertainty is proposed.Decision\u2010making problem formulations for RA in computer networks with unknown parameters of the utility functions and bandwidths based on the network utility maximization concept are given. Solution algorithms for all these problems are proposed.It is assumed that an expert can describe possible values of unknown network parameters in the form of a certainty distribution. Then, the formalism of uncertain variables is applied and the knowledge of an expert is modelled with certainty distributions.The RA \u2026"", ""Utility-based rate control and capacity allocation in virtual networks"": ""In this paper we consider two traffic control problems in virtual networks: transmission rate control and link capacity allocation. It is assumed that the performance of computer network can be described using the network utility maximization framework. The interplay between total utility of virtualized network and total cost incurred by the maintenance of virtualization itself is under consideration. Described optimization problem corresponds to finding equilibrium between these two competing factors. The paper presents how to derive distributed algorithms for the rate control and for the physical resource allocation. Algorithms for a particular form of utility and price functions are proposed and implemented in simulation environment. The convergence analysis of algorithms is provided."", ""Application of uncertain variables to production planning in a class of manufacturing systems"": ""A production planning problem is addressed in the paper. It consists in the determination of a production plan of products to maximize a total utility connected with their manufacture taking into account a limited amount of resources of different types which are necessary for the production. An uncertain version of the problem is considered when an amount of the resources are not precisely known. The formalism of uncertain variables is proposed in the paper to solve this problem. The solution algorithms for two versions of the uncertain production planning problem are presented. It turned out possible to replace the uncertain problems by their deterministic counterparts. A simple numerical example illustrates the solution algorithms.""}"
Rafa≈Ç Palak,Recommendation Systems Collective Intelligence Machine Learning,"{""Prediction markets as a vital part of collective intelligence"": ""Nowadays, collective intelligence becomes more and more popular. Despite its high usability, many aspects of collective intelligence stay unexplored. Many companies have recognized the potential of collective intelligence and have begun using it. Prediction markets are the real life implementation of collective intelligence. The fact that prediction markets outperform experts makes it a great tool for predicting the future. In this paper, we try to answer important questions that have to be asked before the creation of a prediction market e. g. \u201cWhat factors influence the prediction market error and how could this be minimized?\u201d. This paper treats the problems more broadly. Therefore, the areas of collective intelligence that have a strong influence on prediction markets are also included in the problem analysis."", ""Graph-based crowd definition for assessing wise crowd measures"": "" Research in the field of collective intelligence is currently focused mainly on determining ways to provide a more and more accurate prediction. However, the development of collective intelligence requires a more formal approach. Thus the natural next step is to introduce the formal model of collective. Many scientists seem to see this need, but available solutions usually focus on narrow specialization. The problems within the scope of collective intelligence field typically require complex models. Sometimes more than one model has to be used. This paper addresses both issues. Authors introduce graph-based meta-model of collective that intend to describe all collective\u2019s properties based on psychological knowledge, especially on Surowiecki\u2019s work. Moreover, we introduced the taxonomy of metrics that allow assessing the qualitative aspects of crowd\u2019s structure and dynamics."", ""Centralization measures for social networks"": ""Recently online social networks have grown enormously to become an essential marketing tool for many companies. Therefore, identifying the important or central or influential node is a crucial task. Centrality indicates the most central node or most influential node within a network. Centralization has proven to be a vital tool that helps to solve many problems. Besides the existence of numerous centralization measures, there is a lack of requirements for them. The main contribution of this article are postulates for centralization measures that solve this problem by enforcing intuition behind centralization. To prove the legitimacy of these postulates, a few existing measures that have fulfilled all postulates are shown. The proposed postulates are not only helpful during the formation of new measures but they also represent the perfect tool to compare two different measures."", ""An independence measure for expert collections based on social media profiles"": ""According to current research, a crowd can outperform experts. Surowiecki in his work, has distinguished decentralization, independence, and diversity as key factors of good crowd performance. Due to lack of mathematical models for modelling these aspects, it is still impossible to prove that they have a big impact on the crowd performance. For solving this problem one of the very important crowd metrics called independence measure should be defined and this is the objective of our paper. Proposed measure allows calculating independence values based on data from social media profiles. The biggest advantage of the measure is the possibility of calculating an independence value for a group of people before it could become a collective for realizing concrete objectives. Currently, known solutions largely simplify the problem by describing independence with a single value. The solution presented in \u2026"", ""An effective collaborative filtering based method for movie recommendation"": ""Collaborative filtering approach is one of the most widely used in recommendation processes. The big problem of this approach is its complexity and scalability. This paper presents an effective method for movie recommendation based on collaborative filtering. We show that the computational complexity of our method is lower than one known from the literature, worked out by Lekakos and Caravelas (Multimedia Tools Appl 36(1\u20132):55\u201370 (2006), [10]).""}"
Hubert Zarzycki,,"{""Drones and possibilities of their using"": ""This article shows the drones and possibilities of their using. First there was discussed construction of the drone, which the most important elements are frame, propellers, engine, system of power the electronic control and communication system. A drone is powered by batteries, which is the major drawback, because it is exhausted after 15 minutes of flight, causing a decrease drone on the ground. The lithium-polymer batteries are used for powering the drones. Then there were compared the military and civilian drones on selected examples. Military drones differ from civil of size and drive. They are bigger and powered by internal combustion engines. Civil drones are driven by electric motors. Next there were shown the possibilities of using the drones. They can be used by the public services (like police, fire brigades, border guards), by army, in industry, for taking photos and filming, in delivering shipments. The article shows the danger connecting with using the drones. The main danger of using the drones is the fall of a drone from a great height, which may be due discharge of the battery, damage caused by weather conditions (low air temperature, precipitation), hitting in an obstacle (tree, building, high-voltage line). Currently a lot of projects related to the development of power for drones are conducted like battery of grapheme, pure lithium anodes, and fuel cells. A very important risks associated with the extensive use of civilian drones is related with privacy and the rights of citizens."", ""Application of rough sets in the presumptive diagnosis of urinary system diseases"": ""The main idea of this article is to prepare the model of the expert system, which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. This is an example of the rough sets theory application to generate the set of decision rules in order to solve a medical problem. The lower and upper approximations of decision concepts and their boundary regions have been formulated here. The quality and accuracy control for approximations of decision concepts family has been provided as well. Also, the absolute reducts of the condition attributes set have been separated Moreover, the certainty, support and strength factors for all of the rules have been precisely calculated. At the end of the article, the author has also shown the reverse decision algorithm."", ""AAO as a new strategy in modeling and simulation of constructional problems optimization"": ""The article presents a new multi-criteria optimization method called Artificial Acari Optimization (AAO). AAO method was tested with five well-known benchmark structural problems i.e.: welded beam, pressure vessel, speed reducer, spring design and gear train problem. The results were compared on other representatives of Swarm Intelligence mainstream which are bee algorithms MBO, BCO and ABC. Numerous references show dominance of ABC over MBO and BCO. To check this, a detailed comparisons of AAO results were made and introduced together with the results of the ABC algorithm."", ""Protection tool for distributed denial of services attack"": ""This article presents a potential tool for solving one of the biggest problems of security of network resources in computer networks. This problem are the Distributed Denial of Service attacks, which are able to block the computer networks. The authors introduce the nature of the problem and subsequently present a tool which provides a possible solution to deal with it. The proposed methods have already been tested in the range of their impact on network resources. The results presented in this article suggest that the method may be implemented as an efficient solution for some DDoS attacks."", ""Application of ordered fuzzy numbers in a new ofnant algorithm based on ant colony optimization"": ""This paper describes the results of experiments concerning the optimization method called OFNAnt. As the benchmarks, the author used the set of files from TSPlib repository which includes well known samples of the travelling salesman problem. The innovation of the proposed method consists in implementation of Ordered Fuzzy Numbers to the decision-making process of individual ant agents. This also made it possible to correlate the colony development optimization with the trend. Previous implementations of the fuzzy logic to such meta heuristics like ant systems came down to fuzzy control over the decision-making process of an ant or fuzzy control of the pheromone release mechanism. Thanks to the proposed method, it was possible to expand the family of solutions with the solutions represented by ants moving outside the main circulation. The improvement was possible thanks to better stress that \u2026""}"

Different aspects and contradictory preferences of individual stakeholders/carpoolers (drivers and passengers), including: economic, comfort- and safety-oriented, and social are considered. The formulated problem is focused on the joint matching of carpoolers and planning their routes in order to maximize the utility of all travelers. To solve the problem, the authors develop a heuristic computational procedure that applies a problem-specific heuristic method (carpooler\u2019s matching component) combined with a utility-based shortest path algorithm (routing component). The procedure aggregates all of the considered criteria by a weighted scaling function and then applies a greedy algorithm to generate most satisfactory routes for all of the \u2026"", ""Multiple criteria optimization of the carpooling problem"": ""The paper presents a multiple criteria (MC) formulation of the carpooling optimization (CO) problem and a solution procedure that allows to solve it. The mathematical model of the MCCO problem includes two major sub-problems, such as planning of the routes and matching carpoolers (drivers and passengers). Different aspects, including: economic, social, technical and market-oriented are considered. The MCCO problem is solved with the application of an original computational procedure based on the multiple criteria genetic algorithm, called NSGA II and the solutions\u2019 analysis and review technique, called Light Beam Search (LBS) method. The former method allows to generate a set of Pareto optimal solutions, while the latter assists the carpoolers in finding the most desired compromise solution (common route and match between carpoolers).

We find \u2026"", ""The multiple criteria optimization problem of joint matching carpoolers and common route planning: Modeling and the concept of solution procedure"": ""The paper concerns a joint problem of matching carpoolers and planning common routes as a multiple criteria optimization problem. The model of the optimization problem, as well as the concept of solution procedure, is presented. The solution algorithm uses dynamic programming method and Dijkstra algorithm to obtain matches of the carpoolers and routes. The solution is evaluated by aggregated quality index taking into account preferences of carpoolers equally, concerning all the criteria. Preferences are obtained by AHP method."", ""Multiple criteria optimization of the joint vehicle and transportation jobs selection and vehicle routing problems for a small road freight transportation fleet"": ""We consider a joint problem of selecting transportation jobs and designing transportation routes for small freight transportation fleet owners. The problem is formulated as a multiple criteria optimization problem with several stakeholders: the driver, the fleet owner and the clients. The problem formulation includes driving and work time regulation constraints, takes into account driver comfort and safety, as well as the lateness of the job execution and the time constraints on the pickup and the delivery. Furthermore, the selection of the vehicle is included as a part of the decision making process. The problem is heavily constrained and cannot be solved exactly in reasonable time. We propose an iterative solution algorithm which we evaluate in a series of computational experiments performed on a subset of the transportation network of Poland."", ""An algorithm for rescheduling of trains under planned track closures"": ""This work considered a joint problem of train rescheduling and closure planning. The derivation of a new train run schedule and the determination of a closure plan not only must guarantee the satisfaction of all the given constraints but also must optimize the number of accepted closures, the number of approved train runs, and the total time shift between the resultant and the original schedule. Presented is a novel nonlinear mixed integer optimization problem which is valid for a broad class of railway networks. A multi-level hierarchical heuristic algorithm is introduced due to the NP-hardness of the considered optimization problem. The algorithm is able, on an iterative basis, to jointly select closures and train runs, along with the derivation of a train schedule. Results obtained by the algorithm, launched for the conducted experiments, confirm its ability to provide acceptable and feasible solutions in a reasonable amount of time.""}"
