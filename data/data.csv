Jarosław Drapała, mathematical modelingdynamical systemsmachine learningexploratory data analysis, "Comparisons of cognitive impairments between schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) have produced mixed results. We applied different working memory (WM) measures (Digit Span Forward and Backward, Short-delay and Long-delay CPT-AX, N-back) to patients with SZ (n = 23), psychotic BPD (n = 19) and non-psychotic BPD (n = 24), as well as to healthy controls (HC) (n = 18) in order to compare the level of WM impairments across the groups. With respect to the less demanding WM measures (Digit Span Forward and Backward, Short-delay CPT-AX), there were no between group differences in cognitive performance; however, with respect to the more demanding WM measures (Long-delay CPT-AX, N-back), we observed that the groups with psychosis (SZ, psychotic BPD) did not differ from one another, but performed poorer than the group without a history of psychosis (non-psychotic BPD). A history of psychotic symptoms may influence cognitive performance with respect to WM delay and load effects as measured by Long-delay CPT-AX and N-back tests, respectively. We observed a positive correlation of WM performance with antipsychotic treatment and a negative correlation with depressive symptoms in BPD and with negative symptoms in SZ subgroup. Our study suggests that WM dysfunctions are more closely related to a history of psychosis than to the diagnostic categories of SZ and BPD described by psychiatric classification systems."
Krzysztof Brzostowski, nonlinear signal processingtime-frequency analysissparsity techniquessystem identificationdata fusion, "Mathematical models delivered using both expert knowledge and experimental data improve understanding of dynamic properties of the system under consideration. This is useful for different purposes, such as prediction, diagnosis, decision making, and system control. A data-driven approach has been found to be particularly useful in designing adaptive decision support systems. We demonstrate the usefulness of data-driven models in a custom application designed for sport training management. We have developed a system that makes use of expert knowledge together with measurement data (heart rate, electromyography, and acceleration) as well as environmental (Global Positioning System) in order to generate an optimal training plan. The system performs such tasks as modeling of the athlete's cardiovascular system, estimation of the athlete's parameters, and adaptation of the model to the athlete."
Dariusz Gąsior, virtual networksautonomic networksself-managed networks,"In this paper we introduce a capacity allocation game which models the problem of maximizing network utility from the perspective of distributed noncooperative agents. Motivated by the idea of self-managed networks, in the developed framework the decision-making entities are associated with individual transmission links, deciding on the way they split capacity among concurrent flows. An efficient decentralized algorithm is given for computing a strongly Pareto-optimal strategies, constituting a pure Nash equilibrium. Subsequently, we discuss the properties of the introduced game related to the Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. The paper is concluded with an experimental study."
Grzegorz Popek, artificial cognitionmulti-agent systems, "To enable artificial systems to meaningfully use a semantic language of communication is one of the long-term and key targets not only in the field of artificial cognitive agents, but also of AI research in general. Given existing solutions for grounding of modal statements of a language of communication and an idea to model internal concepts of the agent as zadehian fuzzy-linguistic concepts, this paper shows how to meaningfully combine the two within a single framework. An accomplished goal is a model for grounding of modal and non-modal statements of a language of communication based on concepts modelled internally as fuzzy sets spanned over the domain of observation. This paper describes a way in which fuzzy-linguistic concepts are activated by perceptual inputs and how an agents grounds respective non-modal statements. Further, an agent supposed to describe an unobserved part of the"
Zbigniew Pliszka, genetic algorithms artificial immunologyoptimization, "In this paper we study the search abilities of binary one-point crossover (1ptc) operator in a genetic algorithm (GA). We show, that under certain conditions, GA is capable of using only a 1ptc operator to explore the entire search space, fighting premature convergence. Further, we prove that to restore the entire space from any two binary chromosomes, each of length n, at least 2 n - 1 - 1 one-point crossover operations is needed. This number can serve as a measure for comparing the search speed of the different algorithms. Moreover, we propose an algorithm spanning the search space in the minimal number of crossovers."
hubert Zarzycki, , "This article shows the drones and possibilities of their using. First there was discussed construction of the drone, which the most important elements are frame, propellers, engine, system of power the electronic control and communication system. A drone is powered by batteries, which is the major drawback, because it is exhausted after 15 minutes of flight, causing a decrease drone on the ground. The lithium-polymer batteries are used for powering the drones. Then there were compared the military and civilian drones on selected examples. Military drones differ from civil of size and drive. They are bigger and powered by internal combustion engines. Civil drones are driven by electric motors. Next there were shown the possibilities of using the drones. They can be used by the public services (like police, fire brigades, border guards), by army, in industry, for taking photos and filming, in delivering shipments. The article shows the danger connecting with using the drones. The main danger of using the drones is the fall of a drone from a great height, which may be due discharge of the battery, damage caused by weather conditions (low air temperature, precipitation), hitting in an obstacle (tree, building, high-voltage line). Currently a lot of projects related to the development of power for drones are conducted like battery of grapheme, pure lithium anodes, and fuel cells. A very important risks associated with the extensive use of civilian drones is related with privacy and the rights of citizens."
Ngoc Thanh Nguyen, knowledge engineeringcollective intelligence, "The binding pose and affinity between a ligand and enzyme are very important pieces of information for computer-aided drug design. In the initial stage of a drug discovery project, this information is often obtained by using molecular docking methods. Autodock4 and Autodock Vina are two commonly used open-source and free software tools to perform this task, and each has been cited more than 6000 times in the last ten years. It is of great interest to compare the success rate of the two docking software programs for a large and diverse set of protein–ligand complexes. In this study, we selected 800 protein–ligand complexes for which both PDB structures and experimental binding affinity are available. Docking calculations were performed for these complexes using both Autodock4 and Autodock Vina with different docking options related to computing resource consumption and accuracy. Our calculation results …"
Jerzy Świątek, Uczenie Maszynowe Identyfikacja SystemówSystemy ZłożoneProcesy Biologiczne, "In this paper, we present boosted SVM dedicated to solve imbalanced data problems. Proposed solution combines the benefits of using ensemble classifiers for uneven data together with cost-sensitive support vectors machines. Further, we present oracle-based approach for extracting decision rules from the boosted SVM. In the next step we examine the quality of the proposed method by comparing the performance with other algorithms which deal with imbalanced data. Finally, boosted SVM is used for medical application of predicting post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients."
Rafał Palak, Recommendation Systems Collective Intelligence Machine Learning,"Nowadays, collective intelligence becomes more and more popular. Despite its high usability, many aspects of collective intelligence stay unexplored. Many companies have recognized the potential of collective intelligence and have begun using it. Prediction markets are the real life implementation of collective intelligence. The fact that prediction markets outperform experts makes it a great tool for predicting the future. In this paper, we try to answer important questions that have to be asked before the creation of a prediction market e. g. “What factors influence the prediction market error and how could this be minimized?”. This paper treats the problems more broadly. Therefore, the areas of collective intelligence that have a strong influence on prediction markets are also included in the problem analysis."
